Over the last few months, we have been working on a brand new product. Last year, our work revolved around providing past questions to help students prepare for WAEC and JAMB. Today, we are happy to announce that we are releasing [Studymono Courses](https://www.studymono.com/learn).

# What is Studymono Courses

While revising exam past questions is a great way of preparing for examinations, preparinf for examinations involves more than that. That is why we are launching Studymono courses today in Alpha. Studymono courses is a collection of articles that help you understand the central of a topic.

In Studymono Courses, we refer to a topic as a theme. A theme consists of various bite sized articles that progress from the basics of the theme and goes on to more advanced topics. We designed Studymono courses in a way that every piece of information you need to understand a theme is included in it so little to no background knowledge will be required to start a theme and complete it.

# What being in Alpha means for Studymono Courses

We are launching Studymono Courses today, not because it is perfect, but because we would like to hear feedback from you. We will use the feedback we receive from you to improve future versions of Studymono Courses. We are launching today with a single theme: Gravity and Gravitational Fields. We will be uploading a new think once a few throughout the upcoming months. When we see that the Studymono Courses is stable enough, we will move to Alpha and then finally launch it as a complete product.

We hope you enjoy this new project from Studmyono. At Studymono, we continue to live our mission: to make education accessible to Nigerian students.
